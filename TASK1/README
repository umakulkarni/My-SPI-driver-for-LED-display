	main3_1.c, my_unexport.c
============================================

This directory contains 2 files main3_1.c and my_unexport.c.

main3_1.c -	This is a user application displaying distance controlled
            animation. To increase the accuracy of measurement and decrease the noise, range
            of object should be within 3.5 cm to 55 cm. If checked out of the range,
            program works but some noise may appear. This program runs infinitely.
            Stop this program by pressing ctrl + c.


my_unexport.c	- This is program to facilitate unexporting of gpio which we have
                requested in above user application. This needs to be done
                before running task 2.

	Compilation
================================

To compile the driver and user-space application use:

Change your linux terminal's present directory path to where tasks are saved.

Give the source of kernel
“source ~/SDK/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux”.

Make the executable of user program main3_1 by using command
“$CC -o main3_1 main3_1.c -lpthread”

Transfer the module and user program to board kernel using command
“scp -r <file_name> root@<inet_address>:/home/root”

Run the executable by using command “./main3_1” on PUTTY terminal.
To delete these files  use:

bash:~ make clean


	Usage
=================================

Measured distance is used as a parameter to control the animation. Speed of dog
in the animation (from running to walking) depends upon how fast the object in
front is moving. Also direction depends on whether object is moving towards the
sensor or away from the sensor. If object is moving towards the sensor, dog will
move in right direction and if it is going far, dog will change direction to left.
To increase the accuracy of measurement and decrease the noise, range of object
should be within 3.5cm to 55 cm. If checked out of the range, program works with
some noise.
Change in distance from sensor of the object should be minimum 0.85 cm to be
detectable by sensor.
The distance to the object is Test distance = (pulse width * 340 m/s) / 2
