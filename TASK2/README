	main3_2.c, pulse.c spi_led.c
============================================

This directory contains 3 files main3_2.c, pulse.c and spi_led.c.


pulse.c -	This is a driver for pulse measurement. This is implemented in non blocking way.
          A write system call is called from user application to trigger a pulse.
          Interrupt is taken on GPIO15. A read is called to receive measured pulse
          width once ready. Distance to the object is calculated taking ultrasonic
          spread velocity in consideration.


spi_led.c	- This is a device driver for spi interface of led matrix display.
            This is implemented in non blocking way. 10 patterns are buffered in
            the driver using IOCTL command. According to distance to the object,
            specific sequence is displayed with given delay. (0, 0) is termination
            symbol. Led matrix will display the same sequence unless change in
            distance is notified.  Termination sequence of (0, 0) is given by user
            application to stop kernel as well as user threads. This facilitates
            to clear led display and both drivers can	be successfully removed.


main3_2.c -	This is a user application displaying distance controlled animation.
            Range of object should be within 65 cm. If distance is > 65 cm, termination
            command is given and display is turned off.

Note: STRICTLY USE TAB WIDTH OF 4 TO VIEW BOTH ' .C' FILES



	Usage
=================================

Measured distance is used as a parameter to control the animation. A part of "Tetris" video game is implemeted here. A device driver
will measure distance to the object using trigger- echo mechanism. This distance
is communicated to user application. User application will choose the pattern to
display according to distance. Specific sequence is displayed with given delay.
(0, 0) is termination symbol. Led matrix will display the same sequence unless
change in distance is notified. Sequence is changed according to distance to the
object.

Distance is divided as:
a) 0 - 17cm : Dancing Robot
b) 17cm - 45cm : Tetris Game
c) 45cm - 65cm : Smiley, Game finished.
d) > 65cm. : Turn of the display.

DO NOT USE CTRL+C TO CLEAR DISPLAY OR STOP USER APPLICATION. When object is at distance > 65cm,
all kernel and user threads will terminate.

The distance to the object is Test distance = (pulse width * 340 m/s) / 2



	Compilation
================================

To compile the driver and user-space application use:

Change your linux terminal's present directory path to where tasks are saved.

Give the source of kernel
“source ~/SDK/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux”.

Compile the driver module using “make” command.

Make the executable of user program main3_2 by using command
“$CC -o main3_2 main3_2.c -lpthread”

Transfer the module and user program to board kernel using command
“scp -r <file_name> root@<inet_address>:/home/root”

Insert driver modules using insmod <>.

Run the executable by using command “./main3_2” on PUTTY terminal .

To delete these files  use:
bash:~ make clean
